                <h2>Overview</h2>
                Yuan Longping (Chinese: 袁隆平; born September 7, 1930) is a Chinese agronomist and 
                educator, known for developing the first hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s.
                Hybrid rice has since been grown in dozens of countries in Africa, America, and 
                Asia—providing a robust food source in areas with a high risk of famine. For his 
                contributions, Yuan is sometimes called the "Father of Hybrid Rice" by the Chinese 
                media.
                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                In 1979, his technique for hybrid rice was introduced into the United States, making 
                it the first case of intellectual property rights transfer in the history of the 
                People's Republic of China. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 1991 
                statistics show that 20 percent of the world's rice output came from 10 percent of the 
                world's rice fields that grow hybrid rice.
                <h2>Honors and awards</h2>
                Four asteroids and a college in China have been named after him.
                Yuan won the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award of China in 2000, the Wolf 
                Prize in Agriculture and the World Food Prize in 2004.
                He is currently the Director-General of the China National Hybrid Rice R&D Center and
                has been appointed as Professor at Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha. He is a 
                member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, foreign associate of the U.S. National 
                Academy of Sciences (2006) and the 2006 CPPCC.
                Yuan worked as the chief consultant for the FAO in 1991.
